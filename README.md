_A mobile app that makes language learning fun and practical. Point your 
camera at objects, and it overlays translations, pronunciations, and example sentences 
to help you learn on the go_

## Medium Fidelity

A web-based prototype of WordLens built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using TensorFlow.js for object recognition. The scanning functionality works and is limited to French translations, with example sentences included. Features like gallery import, camera capture, and settings are not implemented. This version focuses on testing the optimal content size for the pop-up panel before developing the final mobile app
